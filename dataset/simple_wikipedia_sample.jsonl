{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:14", "title": "Christian", "text": "A Christian () is a person who believes in Christianity, a monotheistic religion. Christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, in the New Testament and interpreted or prophesied in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Christianity is the world's largest religion, with 2.1 billion followers around the world.\nViews of the Bible\nChristians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book, inspired by God. The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, and a collection of writings called the New Testament. Views on the importance of these writings vary. Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament, while others believe the entire Bible is equally important. Also, while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as fully true, not all Christian groups believe that it is completely accurate.\nWho is a Christian?\nThe question of \"Who is a Christian?\" can be very difficult. Christians often disagree over this due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. In countries where most persons were baptized in the state church or the majority Christian church, the term \"Christian\" is a default label for citizenship or for \"people like us\".\nIn this context, religious or ethnic minorities can use \"Christians\" or \"you Christians\" as a term for majority members of society who do not belong to their group - even in a very secular (though formally Christian) society.\nPersons who are more devoted the their Christian faith prefer not to use the word so broadly, but only use it to refer to those who are active in their Christian religion and really believe the teachings of Jesus and their church. In some Christian movements (especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism), to be a born-again Christian is to undergo a \"spiritual rebirth\" by believing in the Bible's teachings about Jesus and choosing to follow him.\nChurch life\nMany Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship. However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church. Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week. On the other hand, Catholics in the past have believed that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church.\nRelated pages\nChristianity\nReligion\nSalvation\nMeitei Christians\nReferences\nChristians", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:22", "title": "Photographic film", "text": "Photographic film is a sheet of plastic for recording visual scenes. The plastic has been specially treated to be sensitive to light. The image is recorded on the plastic when the plastic is exposed to light. Film is kept in small canisters (boxes) which protect it from the light. A normal photographic film may hold up to 40 pictures.\nOnce all pictures have been recorded, the film has to undergo a special chemical treatment. This is called developing a film or film processing. That treatment makes the pictures visible (you can see them), and the exposed film is no longer sensitive to light.\nDifferent kinds of films exist. Some require more light to be exposed than others. Some are black and white only; they record no colors. There are also special films which can record infrared light. Photographic film was invented in the 1880s and replaced the earlier dry plate system.\nFilms also come in different sizes. 35 millimeter film, the most used size, comes in metal cans or canisters, but there are other camera films that come in paper wrappings or in single sheets.\nUses\nFilm can only be used once. After that, it cannot be used again (if it is accidentally used again, this results in an artifact called a multiple exposure). When not in use, film needs to be covered from light, otherwise it will record any lights that shine on it. This will make it useless to record a picture. Film comes in a can called a canister to cover it from light rays.\nFilm needs the right amount of light to make a picture. If the picture is too bright or too dark, it will not record correctly. The longer that the film keeps recording, the more light it will get. If what is being photographed is bright, it will be recorded faster. If it is darker, the film will need more time to record.\nFilms that need less time to record the picture are known as \"faster\" films. Different speeds of films are marked with an ISO number. The higher the number, the faster the films. Films can only make a picture from focused lights. If there is no lens to focus light, the film will only turn white from receiving just the light. If a film with an ISO level of 200 instead of 100 is used, it will only need half as much time to record a picture of the same scene.\nExamples of ISO numbers are ISO 50, ISO 100, IS0 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and ISO 1600. The ISO number is sometimes called the ''ASA number'' or the ''film speed''. When the ISO number is low, for example ISO 50, the film takes a long time to record the picture. This is called a slow film. This means the shutter has to stay open for a long time. When the ISO number is high, for example ISO 800, the picture is made in a very short time. This is a fast film. This means the shutter has to open and close quickly.\nBefore photographic film was invented, photography used glass dry plates. In the 21st century, most cameras don't use film anymore.\nReferences\nRelated pages\nAdvanced Photo System\nCamera\nPhotography", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic%20film"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:33", "title": "Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours", "text": "Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours is a motor racing circuit in France, near the towns of Magny-Cours and Nevers. It is often called just Magny-Cours. It is most well known for hosting the Formula One French Grand Prix, which was held there between 1991 and 2008.\nHistory\nThe circuit was built in 1960 by Jean Bernigaud. It was the home to the L'ecole de pilotage Winfield racing school. The school provided such drivers as Francois Cevert and Jacques Laffite. In the 1980s, the track condition was not very good. It needed a lot of repairs. The circuit was not used for international racing until it was purchased by the Regional Conseil de la Nievre.\nIn the 1990s the Ligier (later known as Prost) Formula One team was based at the circuit. They did a lot of their testing at Magny-Cours. It started hosting the F1 French Grand Prix in 1991, and the Bol d'Or motorcycle race in 2000. The circuit was re-designed in 2003 and used for a wide range of events include various sports and commercial use.\nThe circuit does not provide many overtaking opportunities. The races here are commonly regarded as quite uneventful.\nFor the 2003 event, the final corner and chicane were changed in an effort to increase overtaking. It did not help much. The change did make the pitlane much shorter. Because less time was lost making a pit stop, Michael Schumacher was able to win the 2004 French Grand Prix using a four-stop strategy.\nIn 2006, the circuit was the scene of more Formula One history. Michael Schumacher became the first driver to win a single Grand Prix 8 times at the same circuit.\nThe 2007 race was to mark the last French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours. The French Grand Prix had been indefinitely suspended from the Formula One calendar. Bernie Ecclestone originally said that F1 would not return to Magny-Cours in 2008. He wanted to move to another location, possibly in Paris.\nWhen the official calendar on July 2007, the 2008 French Grand Prix was still in place at Magny-Cours.\nIn May 2008, Ecclestone confirmed that Magny-Cours would stop hosting the French Grand Prix after the 2008 race. He suggested he was looking into hosting the French Grand Prix on the streets of Paris.\nIn June 2008, the provisional calendar for the 2009 season was released. The French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours appeared on it, scheduled for 28 June. However, in October 2008 the 2009 French Grand Prix was canceled after the French Motorsports Federation (FFSA) withdrew financing for the event.\nIn 2009 the track hosted its first Superleague Formula event. It has also been confirmed it will host a second event in 2010.\nThe circuit\nThe current track is a modern, smooth circuit. It has good facilities for the teams and spectators. It is from Paris in central France. Many corners are modeled on famous turns from other circuits, and are named after those circuits. Examples include the fast Estoril corner and the Adelaide hairpin. It has a mix of slow hairpins and high-speed chicane sections. It includes a long fast straight into the first-gear Adelaide hairpin, the best overtaking opportunity on the circuit. The circuit is very flat with little change in elevation. It does not provide many overtaking opportunities, despite modifications in 2003.\nReferences\nOther websites\nCircuit de Nevers Magny-Cours\nGoogle Maps satellite view of Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours\nNevers Magny-Cours History and Statistics\nTrack info from official F1 site\nA lap of Magny-Cours with Honda's Alexander Wurz\nMagny-Cours - the technical requirements\nFormula One circuits\nNievre\nSport in France", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit%20de%20Nevers%20Magny-Cours"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:41", "title": "Sonderkommando", "text": "Sonderkommandos were special work groups made up of prisoners in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. (In German, \"Sonderkommando\" means \"special unit\".) They worked in and around the gas chambers, which the Nazis used to murder many people.\nWhat did the Sonderkommando do?\nThe Sonderkommandos did not kill anybody. When the Nazi guards at the concentration camps killed people in their gas chambers, they made the Sonderkommandos do a few different jobs:\nTake prisoners into the gas chambers\nTake dead bodies out of the gas chambers after the Nazis had killed them\nTake things the Nazis wanted from the dead bodies. For example, they had to take out gold teeth and tooth fillings; cut off the women's hair; and take jewelry and eyeglasses\nBury or burn the dead bodies\nClean the gas chambers and get them ready for the next group of people the Nazis wanted to kill\nLife as a Sonderkommando\nUsually, the Nazi camp guards chose people for the Sonderkommando groups right after those people got to the concentration camps. They almost always chose Jewish prisoners. These people were told they would be killed if they did not agree. They were not told what kind of work they would have to do. Sometimes, the new Sonderkommando would find the bodies of their own families in the gas chambers. They were not allowed to change jobs or refuse to work. The only way they could stop working as Sonderkommando would be to kill themselves.\nSometimes the groups of Sonderkommandos were very big. As the Nazis killed more and more people in the concentration camps, they wanted more Sonderkommandos. By 1943, at Birkenau concentration camp (also called \"Auschwitz II\"), the groups of Sonderkommando included 400 prisoners. But when many more Jews from Hungary were sent to the camp in 1944, the Nazis added 500 more Sonderkommando.\nThe Nazis needed the Sonderkommandos to stay strong enough to work. Because of this, they were treated a little better than the other prisoners. They were allowed to sleep in their own barracks. They were also allowed to keep things like food, medicines, and cigarettes that had belonged to people who were killed in the gas chambers. The Nazis allowed these things because they wanted to be able to kill people as quickly as possible in the gas chambers. Without the Sonderkommando to help with the dead bodies, the Nazis would not be able to use the gas chambers as much.\nDeath\nBecause they knew so much about how the Nazis were killing so many people, the Nazis thought of the Sonderkommando as Geheimnistrager -- people who knew secrets. Because of this, they were kept apart from other prisoners in the camps. The Nazis also did not want anyone outside the camps to know what they were doing. To make sure the Sonderkommando could never tell what they knew, the Nazis would regularly kill all of the Sonderkommando, usually about every 3 months. Then they would choose a new group out of new prisoners just getting to the camps. The new group's first job would be to burn the bodies of the old Sonderkommandos.\nSonderkommandos fight back\nSome Sonderkommandos tried to revolt (fight back) against the Nazis. For example, in 1944, Sonderkommandos at Auschwitz partly destroyed one of the crematoria used for burning bodies. For months, young Jewish women had secretly been taking small amounts of gunpowder from a weapons factory in the Auschwitz camp. They had been sneaking that gunpowder to men and women in the camp's resistance movement. (The resistance movement was a group of prisoners at Auschwitz who decided to fight back against the Nazis, sometimes in secret ways.) Using this gunpowder, the leaders of the Sonderkommando planned to blow up the gas chambers and crematoria, and start a rebellion against the camp's guards.\nHowever, before this plan was ready, people in the camp's resistance movement found out that the Nazi guards were going to murder the Sonderkommando on 7 October 1944. The resistance members warned the Sonderkommando, who attacked the guards with two machine guns, axes, knives and grenades. They killed about 3 guards and hurt about 12 others. A total of 451 Sonderkommandos were killed on this day. Some died fighting the camp's guards. Some did not, and were executed later that day by the Nazis.\nThere were also revolts in two other concentration camps, called Treblinka and Sobibor. At Treblinka, on 2 August 1943, around 100 prisoners were able to escape from the camp. At Sobibor, Sonderkommando in one part of the camp (Camp I) revolted on 14 October 1943. The Sonderkommando in another part of the camp (Camp III) did not revolt, but were murdered the next day.\nOther Sonderkommandos fought back secretly. For example, at Auschwitz, in August 1944, members of the Sonderkommando were able to take pictures showing bodies being burned and people being sent to the gas chambers. They snuck these pictures out of the camp as proof of what the Nazis were doing.\nFewer than twenty out of several thousand members of the Sonderkommando are known to have survived and were able to testify to what happened. After World War II, at some camps, people found notes that members of the Sonderkommando had buried or hidden, hoping that someone would find the notes later and know what happened.\nTestimonies\nBetween 1943 and 1944, some members of the Sonderkommando at Birkenau (Auschwitz II) were able to get pens and paper, and they wrote about the things they had seen at the camp. They buried the things they wrote near the crematoria. Their writings were found after the war ended.\nFor example, this note was found buried in the Auschwitz crematoria. It was written by Zalman Gradowski, a Sonderkommando who was killed in the revolt on 7 October 1944:\"Dear finder of these notes, I have one request of you ... that my days of Hell, that my hopeless tomorrow will find a purpose in the future. I am transmitting [writing about] only a part of what happened in the Birkenau-Auschwitz Hell. You will realize what reality looked like ...

He lived in the period known as the Baroque period. His most famous music is his Te Deum. This work begins with a prelude which today is extremely popular. It was the signature tune for the European Broadcasting Union where it was used to introduce programmes such as the Vienna New Year's Concert and the Eurovision Song Contest. It is often used as a voluntary for weddings.\nLife\nWe do not know much for certain about his early life. He went to Italy where he learned a lot by studying the music of Italian composers. He studied with the composer Giacomo Carissimi for several years.\nWhen he returned to France he got a job as musician to the Duchess of Guise who was a rich lady who employed several musicians. He worked for her for many years, both as a singer (he had a high tenor voice known in French as an \"haute-contre\"), and as a composer. When the great playwright Moliere stopped working with Lully he asked Charpentier to work with him. He wrote music for several plays by Moliere including Le malade imaginaire. After Moliere's died in 1673, Charpentier continued to write for other playwrights such as Thomas Corneille and Jean Donneau de Vise. He often used more musicians than he was allowed (only Lully, the king's composer, was allowed to use lots of musicians for his performances). In the end Charpentier stopped writing music for plays.\nIn 1679, Charpentier was invited to compose for the king's son, the Dauphin. The Dauphin had a private chapel and Charpentier wrote religious music for him. In 1683 he was given a royal pension. In April of that year he became very ill and could not work for a time.\nFrom late 1687 to early 1698, Charpentier was maitre de musique to the Jesuits, Soon he stopped composing big works such as oratorios and concentrated on smaller works for church worship which were sometimes played by a large number of players. He also was music teacher to the Duke of Chartres.\nIn 1698 he was made maitre de musique at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This was one of the top musical jobs in France (the only better job in sacred music in France was director of the royal chapel at Versailles). He kept this job until his death in 1704. After his death nearly all the works he wrote for the Chapel were destroyed. This was the usual procedure when a maitre de musique died. His famous Mass Assumpta Est Maria has survived. Perhaps that is because it was not composed for the Chapel.\nHis music\nCharpentier's compositions include oratorios, masses, operas, and many smaller works. He also wrote a lot of music for plays. Many of his smaller works for one or two voices and instruments he called air serieux or air a boire if they are in French, but cantata if they are in Italian.\nBibliography\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez received her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice is used for the musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip synching. When asked by an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: \"I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6.\nTransition from film to music\nDuring production of the On the 6, Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" Lopez's debut single \"If You Had My Love\" was serviced to radio in the United States on May 4, 1999. The song debuted at 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the week of May 15, 1999, and entered the top ten two weeks later. A month after the single's release, it moved to number six, earning the \"Greatest Gainer\" title of the week, and reached the top spot on June 12, 1999. The song dethroned Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" as the number-one song in the country; this was the first time a Latin artist followed another Latin artist to the top of the chart since Gloria Estefan's \"Coming Out Of The Dark\" replaced Timmy T's \"One More Try\" in March 1991. Lopez also became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single since Britney Spears did with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. \"If You Had My Love\" stayed atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a period of a month, and remained in the top ten until September of 1999. \"If You Had My Love\" was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries.\n\"No Me Ames\", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony was released as a B-side to \"If You Had My Love\" and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The surprising success of both \"If You Had My Love\" and the album made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". Following the release of \"If You Had My Love\" and \"No Me Ames\", three additional singles were released. By the end of 1999, Lopez had successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.\nVideo contents\n\"Rather than the usual collection\", Feelin' So Good provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. It contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as \"very slick and promotional\". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez \"comes through energetically\" and without \"much star-ego\". The video album provides very basic information about the singer's career, rather than going too much into detail. The release has been compared to the DVD releases of Mariah Carey. Cory Rooney and Lopez acted as album executive producers of the DVD, while Lopez acted as a video executive producer, alongside Benny Medina. Jeffrey Norskog acted as a video associate producer.\nChapters overview\nFeelin' So Good opens with a intertitle that features a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for On the 6, artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, \"Why Risk a Music Career?\", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, about the risks of starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the \"next natural step\" in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the \"ultimate\" triple threat - \"the actor, singer and dancer\". Lopez then confers, in the chapter \"Press Tours / Promotions\", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more \"personal\" as it is something that is \"closer to your heart\" and something she \"really believes in\". According to Lopez, by the end of the promotional tour for the album she \"lost\" her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of \"If You Had My Love\" at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown. In the fifth chapter, \"Beginning of the Year\", Lopez discusses her hectic schedule in the beginning of 1999; balancing film events and choosing the album's first single and shooting its music video. Lopez then goes into detail about the concept behind the music video of \"If You Had My Love\".

Following this, the official music video to \"No Me Ames\" is shown.\nIn the eleventh chapter of Feelin' So Good, appropriately entitled \"First Number One Single\", Lopez reveals the moment when she found out that \"If You Had My Love\" went number one in the United States. She then went on to discuss the events that occoured during the release week of On the 6 in \"Record Release Week\". Lopez then reveals how she came to record \"Let's Get Loud\" and her performance of the song at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is shown.

Lopez then speaks of filming the music video for \"Waiting for Tonight\" and behind the scenes footage on set of the video is shown. She also explains how the Hex Hector remix of the song came about and the alternative music video that was created for it. A megamix video of the original and Hex Hector remix follows. The twentieth chapter, \"Jennifer's Mom\", is an interview with Lopez's mother discussing what was like to see Lopez on television for the first time. Lopez then discusses her surprise to the amount of fans she had and their dedication in \"Fan Support\". In \"Working on Record\", the twenty-second chapter of Feelin' So Good, Lopez discusses the process of writing and recording the album. Lopez's sister Lynda interviews her choreographer Tina Landon on what it is like to work with her, before her 1999 Blockbuster Awards performance of \"If You Had My Love\" is shown. Footage is then shown of Lopez \"goofing around\" during a photoshoot, before the music video to her song \"Baila\" is shown, for the very first time. In \"Film Energy vs. Music Energy\" Lopez compares the difference between the fans of her movies and of her music. In the final interview footage of Feelin' So Good, Lopez explains the concept behind the music video of \"Feelin' So Good\" and why Big Pun and Fat Joe were chosen to be featured on the song. The music video is then shown and is faded out into the end credits.\nDVD bonus features\nDigitally remastered with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, the DVD edition of Feelin' So Good contains interactive menus and instant chapter access to songs.

Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD three out of five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will \"greatly enjoy this disc\", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: \"It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although much has been made of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress - I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner\". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the \"Waiting for Tonight\" music video. He concluded by stating that: \"Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout.\"\nCertifications\nReferences\nOther websites\nJennifer Lopez albums\n2000 albums\nCompilation albums\nLatin music albums\nHip hop albums\nR&B albums", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer%20Lopez%3A%20Feelin%27%20So%20Good"}

The club colors were set with black and white. Role models were the district neighbors ASV Hertha Vienna and SpC Rudolfshugel. For the championship, the club was classified in the 2nd class. In the first official championship season in 1911/12, the club finished in good fifth place. With the outbreak of the First world war in 1914, they stopped because most of the players were drafted into military service.\nImmediately after the end of the war, former players and officials got together in 1918 to reactivate the club. The club was also renamed 1. Favoritner FC Vorwarts 06 Vienna. In the 1919/20 season they came back into the 2nd Class, but only came last and were relegated to the Third Class North. After two seasons in this class they became champion and should be promoted to 2. Class A. Due to accusation that the club had used unauthorized players and that witnesses close to him had made false statements, 1. FFC Vorwarts 06 was excluded from the association. After clarification of this matter,Vorwarts was allowed to play again in the 2nd class south in the 1923/24 season.\nThe next years became an integral part of the second class.

In the promotion round itself two victories against the Fussballgemeinschaft Salzburg and a draw against SK Amateure Steyr were only enough for second place behind Steyer.\nIn the 1945/46 season they qualified for the 1st class in Vienna, from which the Favoritner were relegated in the following season.

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:60", "title": "Peace", "text": "Peace is a time without any fights or wars. In a larger sense, peace (or peacefulness) can mean a state of harmony, quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all, like a still pond with no ripples.\nMany people and organizations want peace. One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I. When it did not stop World War II, it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful. This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first, the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first. This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both South Korea and Kuwait when they were attacked.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. wrote in a letter he sent from the Birmingham jail that, \"True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.\" In other words, Real peace is more than just problems being gone: there must be fairness to have peace.\nAlfred Nobel created an annual award, the Nobel Peace Prize, for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world.\nReligious beliefs and peace\nBuddhists think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends.To get rid of suffering and get this peace, many try to follow a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths\nJews and Christians believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with God. Jesus Christ (also called the \"Prince of Peace\" in the Book of Isaiah) said: \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.\" ()\nMuslims follow Prophet Muhammad who teaches them that peace is the glue that holds communities together and sustains the world.\nInner peace\nInner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of stress. Being \"at peace\" is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.\nPeace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer, meditation, Tai chi chuan or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself.\nMovements and activism\nPeace movement\nA movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war, minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, often linked to the goal of achieving world peace. Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of pacifism, non-violent resistance, conscientious objector, diplomacy, boycotts, moral purchasing, supporting anti-war political candidates, demonstrations, and lobbying to create legislation on human rights or of international law.\nTheories on peace\nMany different theories of \"peace\" exist in the world of peace studies, which involves the study of conflict transformation. The definition of \"peace\" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.\nPeace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.\nRelated pages\nAnti-war movement\nCeasefire\nPacifism\nPeace makers\nPeace treaty\nWorld peace\nBasic English 850 words\nSociety", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace"}

However, many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic.\nOverall, this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon. It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans. At least half the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time became extinct. It was a series of extinctions when life was hit by volcanic events.\nA whole class, the conodonts (extinct chordates); 20% of all marine families; all large crurotarsans (non-dinosaurian archosaurs); some remaining therapsids; and many of the large amphibians such as the temnospondyls were wiped out.\nThe event emptied many ecological niches, and allowed the dinosaurs to take over the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years, and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart.\nScientists have suggested several explanations for this event, but all have unanswered challenges:\nAsteroid impact: no known impact crater has been dated to coincide with the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.\nGradual climate change or sea-level fluctuations during the Upper Triassic. Sea level was low at the end of the Triassic, and the climate on Pangaea was arid. However, this does not explain the suddenness of the extinctions.\nMassive volcanic eruptions would release carbon dioxide, which would cause intense global warming, or sulfur dioxide and aerosols, which would cause severe cooling. The flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) occurred at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. This is the favoured explanation of several palaeontologists.\nRecent evidence\nA recent paper in PNAS shows fairly clearly that mass volcanism was involved. It was probably the primary cause of the extinction. Mercury is present in volcanic rocks found at the end-Triassic boundary.\nMercury is emitted in gaseous form during volcanism, and deposited in sediments. The paper says \"Such episodic volcanism likely perturbed the global environment over a long time and strongly delayed ecological recovery\".\nReferences\nExtinction events\nMesozoic", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-Triassic%20extinction%20event"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:64", "title": "Robert Woodward", "text": "Robert Burns Woodward (April 10, 1917 - July 8, 1979) was an American organic chemist. He made many important discoveries in modern organic chemistry. He worked on the synthesis and structure of complex natural products. He worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on the theory of chemical reactions. Woodward won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1965.\nEarly life and education\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts. When he was one year old, his father died in the influenza pandemic of 1918.\nHe was interested in chemistry at an early age. By the time he entered high school, he had already done most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward asked the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston, to send him copies of a few original papers published in German journals. He was fascinated to read Otto Diels and Kurt Alder's original communication about the Diels-Alder reaction.\nIn 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but did not do well enough to continue. MIT readmitted him in 1935, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate. This was very unusual at the time, because most MIT students earned only a Bachelor of Science degree after four years. Woodward's studies were about the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone, a natural type of estrogen. He held a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and stayed at Harvard for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a post which allowed him to spend all his time on research.\nEarly work\nIn the early 1940s Wooward was using ultraviolet spectroscopy to discover the structure of natural products. Woodward collected a large amount of information, and then worked out a series of rules, later called the Woodward's rules. These rules could be used to find out the structures of new natural products, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. Woodward was always quick to use newly developed techniques. Woodward's discovery saved chemists from spending a lot of time using chemical methods to work out the structures of compounds.\nIn 1944 Woodward and William von Eggers Doering reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. The synthesis was a breakthrough, as quinine was hard to get from Japanese occupied southeast Asia. In fact, Woodward's method could not be used on a practical scale, but it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a science. Woodward's synthesis of quinine was the first of many of his very complicated and elegant syntheses.\nLater work and its impact\nBy the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had studied the mechanisms of organic reactions. They had come up with rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was probably the first synthetic organic chemist who used these rules to predict what steps would work in a synthesis.\nOrganic syntheses and Nobel Prize\nDuring the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era'. He showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by very careful planning.\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues. Before he did them, some people thought it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereospecific synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. Woodward was a pioneer in showing how one could conduct reactions that were stereospecific. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.\nDuring World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project.\nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. About terramycin, Woodward's colleague and Nobel Laureate Derek Barton said:\n\"The most brilliant analysis ever done on a structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed an enormous amount of work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.\"\nIn each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, and British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, proposed a structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron. This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry. The field later grew which grew to be important to the chemical industry. Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, with Ernst Otto Fischer. Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\nB12 synthesis and Woodward-Hoffmann rules\nIn the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date- vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning. However, as of 2006, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward-Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions. Woodward based his ideas on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify the ideas. This was done using Hoffmann's Extended Huckel method. The predictions of these rules were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach. Woodward had died two years before and so was not eligible to share this Prize.\nA recent paper in the journal Nature describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate Woodward-Hoffman rules.\nWoodward Institute and later life\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\nWoodward Research Institute, based at Basel, Switzerland in 1963. He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said:\n\"I owe a lot to Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.\"\nPublications\nDuring his lifetime, Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers. The remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\nIdiosyncracies\nHis lectures were legendary and frequently used to last for three or four hours. [His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", and thereafter his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long!] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and used to draw beautiful structures by using multicolored chalk. As a result, it was always easy to take good notes at a Woodward lecture. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His famous Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and all his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue \"tie\" appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and a martini or two. Hoffmann would correspond with Woodward using blue paper.\nReferences\nSources\nRobert Burns Woodward: Architect and Artist in the World of Molecules; Otto Theodor Benfey, Peter J. T.

There are two countries in the world that call themselves China. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the country most people think of when they hear the name China. The Republic of China (ROC) also calls itself China. It is better known in most of the world as Taiwan.\nTaiwan was a part of China for thousands of years. After the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu was illegally taken by Japan. After World War II, the Japanese gave up any claim to Taiwan, but did not say who they were giving control to. At the time, the Republic of China governed all of China, and represented China in the United Nations. After losing a civil war in 1949, the ROC government fled to the island of Taiwan, leaving the PRC to control mainland China. The PRC says it owns the island of Taiwan (which is also known as Taiwan province) and the other islands. The ROC says that it was--and is--the rightful government of China, including mainland China, Taiwan, and Mongolia. In 1971, the ROC lost its United Nations seat as China. The seat was given to the PRC instead. This made the PRC the recognized government of China internationally. The major problems are about whether Taiwan is a part of the PRC or should be an independent country.\nCurrent status\nToday, the ROC (Taiwan) is a fully democratic society, with its own economy, currency, military, and elected officials. The Chinese mainland is ruled by the communist PRC government. Most countries have accepted the PRC as the leaders of China. Several countries, including the United States, have been careful to not say officially which parts of the original China are part of the PRC. 14 countries have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Those who don't usually have un-official de facto embassies and do business with Taiwan mostly as normal, aside from recognizing it as a country.\nThe current state of Taiwan and China is called the \"status quo\", which means neither side is trying to change the way things are. However, the PRC often threatens to use military force to change the situation and bring Taiwan under PRC control. Some people in Taiwan want Taiwan to formally become the Republic of Taiwan, an independent country. This would change the status quo also, and many Taiwanese prefer not to do this, in order to maintain peace. In opinion polls, only a very small percentage of Taiwanese people want to rejoin with the mainland.\nViews by other countries\nToday, most countries of the world see the PRC as China. Most countries however still have a very close economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan, even if they have major tensions with the PRC.\nProblems\nThe relations between the PRC and Taiwan are tense. The PRC believes that Taiwan is a part of the PRC. The government of the PRC has said that if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan, that they will invade Taiwan and stop this from happening. In March 2004, they passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if Taiwan tries to leave the PRC and become an independent country. This law has caused problems with the people in Taiwan. It has caused even more people in Taiwan not to want to be a part of PRC China.\nAnother issue is how a war for Taiwan would grow to include the United States, who has said it would help defend Taiwan, and Australia and Japan, who also hint at helping Taiwan in case of war.\nPolitics of China\nPolitics of Taiwan", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political%20status%20of%20Taiwan"}

This letter is called 'okina in Hawaiian and Samoan. In Malay the glottal stop is written with the letter (at the end of words). In Voro and Maltese, it is written with .\nOther writing systems also have letters for the glottal stop. For example, the Hebrew alphabet uses the letter aleph . Cyrillic has the letter palochka . This letter is used in several Caucasian languages. Modern Latin alphabets for some Indigenous Languages of the Caucasus use the letter heng (' '). In Tundra Nenets, it is written with the letters apostrophe and double apostrophe . In Japanese, glottal stops occur at the end of interjections of surprise or anger and are written with .\nWhen most Philippine languages are written, the glottal stop is not written all the time. Usually, a word that begins with a vowel (for example, Tagalog , \"dog\") is always pronounced with a glottal stop before that vowel. (This also happens in Modern German and Hausa.) This glottal stop is not written. Some orthographies (or ways of writing words) use a hyphen instead of the reverse apostrophe if the glottal stop is in the middle of the word (e.g. Tagalog , \"love\"; or Visayan gabi-i, \"night\"). If it is at the end of a word, the last vowel is written with a circumflex accent (known as the pakupya) if the last vowel is stressed and there is a glottal stop in the final vowel (for example, basa, \"wet\"). If the stress is on the penultimate, or second-to-last, syllable, then a grave accent (known as the paiwa) is used (for example, bata, \"child\").\nSome Canadian indigenous languages, especially some of the Salishan languages, use the letter ? itself as part of their writing systems. In some of them, there are uppercase and lowercase letters for the glottal stop: and . The number 7 or question mark is sometimes used instead of ?. Some languages, such as Squamish, use this instead of ?. SENCOTEN uses the comma to write the glottal stop. However, this is optional in SENCOTEN.\nIn 2015, two women challenged the government of the Northwest Territories. They wanted to use the ? character in their daughters' names: Sahai?a, a Chipewyan name, and Sakae?ah, a Slavey name. The government told them that the identity documents the government uses could not have the letter ? on them. Because of this, the women instead used hyphens in their daughters' names. After this, they continued to challenge the government.\nIn the Crow language, the glottal stop is written as a question mark: ?. The only time the glottal stop is used in Crow is as a question marker morpheme, at the end of a sentence. (A question marker makes a sentence into a question.)\nExamples\nReferences\nBibliography\nConsonants", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal%20stop"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:87", "title": "Bridge to Terabithia (2007 movie)", "text": "Bridge to Terabithia is a fantasy movie. It was released in 2007. The director of the movie was Gabor Csupo. It was adapted for a movie by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The movie is based on the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name. Walt Disney Pictures distributed the movie in the U.S.A. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of two 12-year-old neighbours, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke. They spend their free time in an abandoned tree house where they create a fantasy world called Terabithia.\nDavid Paterson, who wrote the screenplay, is Katherine Paterson's son. The novel is based on parts of his childhood. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed. This was because he could write plays well. Production of the movie began in February 2006. The movie was shot by November. It was shot mainly in Auckland, New Zealand within two months. It took ten weeks to edit the movie. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took many months.\nBridge to Terabithia was released in the US and Canada on February 16, 2007. The movie was successful in terms of earnings. With a budget of around $20 million, it collected US$137 million worldwide. The movie received positive reviews. Critics called it faithful to the children's novel. They said the visuals and performances made the movie imaginative. Bridge to Terabithia was nominated for seven awards. It won five of them at the Young Artist Awards.\nPlot\nJesse \"Jess\" Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a fifth grader who wants to be an artist. He lives with his financially poor family in Lark Creek. He rides the bus to school with his little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison). He avoids the school bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, his classmates, Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) tease him. A new student his age named Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) comes to the school. At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters it. She manages to beat all the boys, including Jess. This irritates Jess. While going home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.\nLater in the evening, Jess becomes angry to find his sister has drawn in his notebook. His strict father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. The next day at school, Leslie praises Jess' drawing ability. This is after she sees his notebook. They soon become best friends. After school, they go into the woods. There, they swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house and a broken down truck on the other side of the creek. They invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world reflects their lives. It comes to life as they explore the area. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house and learn about one another.\nLeslie gives Jess an art kit for his birthday. This pleases Jess very much. Later, he gives her a puppy. She names it Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll that looks like Janice Avery, the school bully. At school, May Belle shows her friend Alexandra what she has for her snack, Twinkies. Jess tells her that she should not brag about them. At recess, May Belle tells Jess and Leslie that Janice stole her Twinkies. Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for entering the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a trick on Janice. Everyone laughs at her at the bus for this.\nOnce Leslie's parents finish writing their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness and watches the family. At school on Friday, Leslie hears Janice crying in the bathroom. After Leslie talks with her, she learns that the reason why Janice is a bully is because she is abused by her father. They become friends. Jess and Leslie take Prince Terrein to Terabithia. There they fight off several creatures that look like students at their school. They decide to go home when it starts raining. The creek gets higher than ever due to the rain.\nThe next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, invites him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission. As she is half-asleep, he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess does not ask Leslie to come with him. When he returns home, Jess finds that his father and mother are worried. This is because they did not know where he was. His father tells him that Leslie drowned in the river that morning. This happened when Jess went to the museum. Jess is very sad to hear this. He visits the Burke family home with his parents to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that she loved him. He thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she could not make friends at her old school. Jess feels very guilty for Leslie's death. His father consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake. Jess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites his sister, May Belle to enter Terabithia. She is delighted because she was not allowed to enter before. She and Jess make Terabithia even better, with Jess as king and his sister as princess.\nProduction\nProduction for the movie began in February 2006, with a budget of around $20 million. The main photography for the movie was shot in Auckland, New Zealand in sixty days. movie editing took ten weeks. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The movie was finished by November 2006. This was because the crew \"had to rush\" to finish it by February 16. The movie was directed by Gabor Csupo. Walden Media President Cary Granat first recommended him to direct the movie. Csupo had never done a live-action movie before. However, he said it \"didn't worry Granat in the least\". Csupo noted that he was interested in making the movie. He \"had the ambition to do a live-action movie for a long time\", but that he \"didn't like anything until I read this book\". He called the book \"beautiful\" and said that it \"moved [him]\". The cinematographer of Bridge to Terabithia was Michael Chapman. This was his final movie before he retired. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after the movie because he wanted his last movie to be a good one. He said: \"this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life\".\nCasting\nDirector Csupo stated they had thought of no actors for the movie at first. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupo \"such a beautiful, heartwarming letter\" that showed she loved the book and character. Csupo said Robb was cast for the movie because of \"her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material\". Robb also talked with Lauren Levine, the producer of the movie, before casting even began. \"[T]heir conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role,\" Csupo stated. Levine said \"it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven.\" With regard to the character, Robb said \"[Leslie]'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her.\"\nLevine noted that \"looking for Jess was a really tough hunt. We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident, brave leader in Terabithia. That's a heck of a range for such a young actor.\" Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jess Aarons. He was chosen as they \"felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him\". Hutcherson said that he liked the project because of \"the real life day-to-day drama as well as the arc of the character Jess\".\nThe filmmakers cast Robert Patrick as Jess' father. He was chosen due to his experience in several movies in the past. Patrick explained that he could relate to the plot. He was \"constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid\" himself, and that the movie reminded him of the place where he grew up. He also said that he agreed to act because it was a movie his children could watch.\nBailee Madison was cast as May Belle Aarons. Csupo said they searched for a long time for someone to play her role. She had \"such a charm, even before the camera, she was just like a little sweetheart,\" he said. She was confident, shook hands with everybody and was \"totally sweet and perky\". Csupo was pleased by her attitude and cast her for the movie.\nDesign and effects\nCsupo explained that \"it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story's integrity and the book's integrity.\" There was only a small mention of Jess and Leslie fighting creatures in Terabithia in the book. For this reason, they \"tried to do the absolute minimum, which would be required to put it into a movie version\".\nTo design the creatures of Terabithia, Csupo wanted to use \"little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies.\" He was inspired by Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott. Dima Malanitchev drew the creatures. Csupo helped him in this. Csupo chose Weta Digital render the 3D animation. He \"was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [fact that] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively.\" Weta modified some of the creature designs. However, they mainly used Csupo's original designs.\n100 crew members from Weta worked for the movie. Weta was doing the animations when the movie was being shot. Weta crew members saw the shooting of all scenes involving these creatures. Weta's Matt Aitken said the process of animation was \"split into two steps\". First, natural-looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csupo and Malanitchev. Photoshop pictures made by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio was used for this. The second step was to use the best animation and motion style for the creatures.\nLeslie's costumes in the movie were designed to look as if the character \"might have made some of them herself\". They were updated from those described in the book. This was because the descriptions in the book would appear odd now.\nWriting\nProducer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son. His name was featured on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill. Hill had been struck by lightning. She was killed when they were both eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel. She agreed \"not only because he's [her] son, but also because he's a very good playwright\". Paterson found it difficult to market his screenplay. It was mainly because of Leslie's death. \"[I]f you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit--put her in a light coma and then bring her out\".\nPaterson said it was very important for him to keep the spirit of the book alive. At the same time, he had to change it from \"a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium\". Paterson knew that the movie had to be about friendship and imagination. He focused \"bringing out the emotions of the story.\" He said he found it difficult to write about Terabithia. This was \"because it was too close\". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the movie. \"What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way\", David said. Csupo said that the two main characters are a little bit older in the movie. Csupo claims the movie \"deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that\", so it \"made more sense\" to make the characters older.\nMusic\nThe film's musical score was composed by Aaron Zigman. He was hired after Alison Krauss did not compose the music. Zigman said there are similarities between the music he made fro Bridge to Terabithia and the movie Flicka. He said: \"[...]at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much\", but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. The score he composed for the movie is described as \"very large\" compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that \"Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this movie enabled me to spread my wings out a bit.\" The official soundtrack for the movie was released by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.\nRelease\nPromotion\nReviewers criticized the film's advertisement campaign. One critic said the movie was actually \"grounded in reality far more than in fantasy.\" Another thought, \"far from a computer generated [created] escapist fantasy, this movie is an unpretentious [not pretending] and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss\".\nDistribution\nThe movie premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on February 16, 2007. Paterson, who studied in The Catholic University of America, held a special advance screening of the movie for them. This was shown at the AFI Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland on February 1, 2007. The movie opened in the UK on May 4, 2007, and in New Zealand June 7, 2007. The movie grossed \"a higher-than-expected\" $28,536,717 from 2,284 screens. It earned an average of $9,885 per screen. The opening day had collections of $6.3 million. The movie has a worldwide gross of US$120 million. It grossed $80 million in the US and Canada.\nThe DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released on June 19, 2007 in the US. The DVD and Blu-ray version had \"Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life\", \"Behind the Book: The Themes of Bridge to Terabithia\" It also had \"Keep Your Mind Wide Open\" music video by Robb, and two audio commentaries. The first was with director Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman. The second was with producer Lauren Levine and actors Hutcherson and Robb.\nReception\nCritical reception\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes said 85% of 137 collected reviews for Bridge to Terabithia were positive. The average score was 7.1/10. Critics said the movie was \"a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's novel and a powerful portrayal of love, loss, and imagination through children's eyes. Dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhance the imaginative film\". At Metacritic, the movie got 74 out of 100 from 25 reviews. This meant it received \"generally favorable reviews\".\nJames Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia \"easily the best family feature of the early year\". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script. She said it was \"utterly recognizable and authentic\", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were \"perfectly cast\". Hornaday said the final five minutes showed \"oversweet sentiment.\" Viewers would remember the film's \"warmth and respect with which it pays homage [respect] to first love,\" she added. Jessica Grose of The Village Voice praised director Csupo for not showing \"cutesy tween [neither a child, nor a teenager] stereotypes.\" She felt Jess' relationship with his father made Bridge to Terabithia from \"a good kids movie to a classic contender\". The New York Times Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background \"to find magic in the everyday\", and thought Csupo directed \"like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic\". She particularly praised Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis said the movie handled adult topics with \"with nuance [cleverly] and sensitivity\". Since it was smart and \"delicate as a spider web\", it was the kind of children's movie \"rarely seen nowadays\". Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances. \"[T]he film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint,\" she noted.\nNot all reviews were positive. Claudia Puig of USA Today said \"for a movie about the power of imagination, Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever as you would hope\". Puig said it was an average translation of the novel. But the adult characters were too caricatured or exaggerated in the movie. The real-life portions of the movie were \"derivative and simplistic\", but Jess' emotional feelings seemed \"powerfully authentic, and this is where the movie finds its truth and soul\". The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern felt the movie overused fantasy. The critic added that the \"agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters\". The young members of the cast were \"appealing but unpolished\". Morgenstern thought Csupo lacked experience in direction. Although Deschanel was the best among the adults, she seemed self-directed.\nAwards and nominations\nBridge to Terabithia was nominated for seven awards. It won five of these. Josh Hutcherson was nominated at the 2008 Saturn Awards for \"Best Performance by a Younger Actor\". AnnaSophia Robb was nominated for a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for \"Best Young Actress\". The film won five awards at the Young Artist Awards. This included \"Best Family Feature Film (Fantasy or Musical)\" and \"Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actor\" for Hutcherson. Robb won \"Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actress\", and Bailee Madison won \"Best Performance in a Feature Film - Young Actress Age Ten or Younger\". The cast also won the award for \"Best Performance in a Feature Film - Young Ensemble Cast\". The cast included Hutcherson, Robb, Madison, Wakefield, Clinton, Lawless, Isabelle Rose Kircher, Carly Owen, Devon Wood, Emma Fenton and Grace Brannigan.\nReferences\nOther websites\nOfficial Bridge to Terabithia website and trailer at Disney\nInterview with Katherine Paterson\nBridge to Terabithia Blu-ray Disc Review\n2007 movies\nAmerican family movies\n2000s family movies\n2000s American fantasy movies\nMovies based on books\nNew Zealand movies\nMovies set in forests\nMovies set in museums\nMovies about child death\nMovies about bullying\nMovies about families", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge%20to%20Terabithia%20%282007%20movie%29"}

It is separated into the fortified Cite de Carcassonne and the more expansive lower city, the ville basse.\nThis bastide, which was thoroughly restored from 1853 by the theorist and architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997.\nHistory\nRomans fortified the hilltop of Carcassonne around 100 BC and eventually made it the colonia of Julia Carsaco, later Carcasum. The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo-Roman times.\nIn 462 the Romans officially left and the Visigothic king Theodoric II built more fortifications at Carcassonne, some of them still stand. In 760, Pippin was unable to take Carcassonne, although he was able to most of the south of France.\nIn 1067 Carcassonne became the property of Raimond Bernard Trencavel, viscount of Albi and Nimes. Carcassonne became famous in its role in the Albigensian Crusades, when the city was a stronghold of occitan cathars. In August 1209 the crusading army of Simon de Montfort forced its citizens to surrender. He added to the fortifications. Carcassonne became a border citadel between France and Aragon.\nGeography\nCarcassonne is at about southeast of Toulouse in the space between the Pyrenees and the Massif Central of France. It is at the crossing of two major traffic routes: the route leading from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and that from the Massif Central to Spain, skirting the Pyrenees. Both routes exist since ancient history.\nThe commune is in the valley of the Aude river. Another river that flows through the city is the Fresquel river. The Canal du Midi also flows through the commune.\nThe commune of Carcassonne has an area of , and its average altitude is ; at the city hall, the altitude is .\nThe commune of Carcassonne is surrounded by the communes:\nClimate\nThe climate of Carcassonne, in the Koppen climate classification, is Cfb - oceanic climate with warm summers.\nPopulation\nThe inhabitants of Carcassonne are known, in French, as Carcassonnais (women: Carcassonnaises ).\nWith a population of 45,941, Carcassonne has a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nEvolution of the population in Carcassonne\nCarcassonne forms, with other 2 communes, the urban area of Carcassonne with a population of 49,257 inhabitants (2013) and an area of . This urban area is the centre of the metropolitan area of Carcassonne, formed by 71 communes with a population of 98,318 inhabitants (2013) and an area of .\nEducation\nA campus of the Ecole nationale de l'aviation civile (French civil aviation academy) is in Carcassonne.\nAdministration\nCarcassonne is the prefecture of the Aude department, the capital of the arrondissement of Carcassonne and the administrative centre () of three cantons:\nCarcassonne-1, with 15,128 inhabitants (2014).\nCarcassonne-2, with 20,700 inhabitants (2014).\nCarcassonne-3, with 21,479 inhabitants (2014).\nIt is part of the intercommunality Carcassonne Agglo ().\nTwinned and partner towns\nCarcassonne is twinned with:\nEggenfelden, Germany\nBaeza, Spain\nHargesheim, Germany\nThe fortified city\nThe fortifications consist of a double ring of ramparts and 53 towers. In 1849, the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc took over restoration works.\nAt his death in 1879 his pupil Paul Boeswillwald, and later the architect Nodet continued the rehabilitation of Carcassonne. The restoration was strongly criticized during Viollet-le-Duc's lifetime because he made the error of using slates and restoring the roofs as pointed cones, where local practice was traditionally of tile roofing and low slopes, as in this region snow was very seldom. But today Viollet-le-Duc's work at Carcassonne is thought to be a work of genius, even if it is not exactly the same as it was.\nTransports\nCarcassonne Airport\nGallery\nRelated pages\nArrondissement of Carcassonne\nCommunes of the Aude department\nReferences\nOther websites\nOfficial website of the city of Carcassonne\nOffice de tourisme de Carcassone\nOnline resource for the Aude & Pyrenees-Orientales , including tourist information for Carcassonne\nCite de Carcassonne, from the French Ministry of Culture\nPhotographs of Carcassonne and the Region\nMany photos of Carcassonne\nTourist attractions in Carcassonne\nOfficial website of Carcassonne Airport\nBastides\nCommunes in Aude\nDepartmental capitals in France\nWorld Heritage Sites in France", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne"}

It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\nThe mountain is the peak of the large shield volcano which forms the island. The crater at the top is wide, with a heart-shaped lake. This lake is normally frozen during the winter, and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow.\nThe only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a small crater on the north shore of the island. The island community had to be evacuated.\nQueen Mary's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid. In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan.\nClimbing the peak\nThe first known attempt to go up to the peak was in 1793 by the French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars. He could not get to the top. However, he collected hundreds of plants. Today, Queen Mary's Peak makes a wonderful but steep climbing route. Climbing it can take 5 to 10 hours, depending on the ability of the walker.

He thought it would look more interesting if the oil was thick enough to form shapes, and spent 10 years trying to make it good.\nEventually, his product was launched in 1963, and Walker's factory soon began production of it as it grew in popularity.\nApparently, Walker once said, \"If you buy my lamp, you won't need drugs.\"\nLava lamps were featured in the sitcom series \"Absolutely Fabulous\", which some people think helped the lava lamp's popularity, which was declining at the time.\nEventually, as it become less popular in the 1980s, Walker sold the company to Elizabeth Granger. Her company, Mathmos, was one of Britain's fastest growing companies, mostly from the lava lamp. Walker believed the lava lamp would be good for her company.\n\"I think it will always be popular.\" he once said. \"It's like the cycle of life.

Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass. The lens makes an image by focusing the light.\nThe majority of cameras only have one lens that users cannot change or take out. This is called a fixed lens design. More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off, so anyone can take out one lens and put in another. A lens may be simple, or may actually be made of several lenses.\nPhotographers can use different lenses (objectives) to make different kinds of pictures. For example, a telephoto lens can take a picture of something far away. A wide-angle lens is the opposite. A zoom lens is more versatile; it can do both. There are many kinds of lenses.\nThe study of lenses and how they work is called optics.\nLenses for large sheet film cameras are especially difficult to design. Cameras and their lenses have been made since the 19th century. Some from before World War II, are still usable today. Computers now let engineers make better lenses, though, because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task. Together with lenses, filters, macro lenses, teleconverters, wide-angle and tele attachments are used.\nCamera lenses", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera%20lens"}

{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:123", "title": "Northern line", "text": "The Northern line is a deep-level tube line on the London Underground, coloured black on the Tube map. It carries more passengers than any other Underground line; 206,734,000 a year.\nFor most of its length it is a deep-level tube line. The portion between and opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level tube line on the Underground network. There were about 252 million passenger journeys recorded in 2011/12 on the Northern line, making it the second-busiest on the Underground. (It was the busiest from 2003 to 2010.) It is unique in having two different routes through central London. Despite its name, it does not serve the northern-most stations on the network, though it does serve the southern-most station, Morden, as well as 16 of the system's 29 stations south of the River Thames. There are 50 stations in total on the line, of which 36 have platforms below ground.\nThe line has a complicated history, and the current complex arrangement of two main northern branches, two central branches and the southern route reflects its genesis as three separate railways, combined in the 1920s and 1930s. An extension in the 1920s used a route originally planned by a fourth company. Abandoned plans from the 1920s to extend the line further southwards, and then northwards in the 1930s, would have incorporated parts of the routes of two further companies. From the 1930s to the 1970s, the tracks of a seventh company were also managed as a branch of the Northern line. An extension from Kennington to Battersea is currently under construction, which may either give the Northern line a second southern branch or may see it split into separate distinct lines with their own identities. It is coloured black on the current Tube map.\nHistory\nEarly History\nThe City and South London Railway (C&SLR) was the first deep-level underground \"tube\" railway in the world, and the first major railway to use electric traction. The railway was originally intended for cable-hauled trains, but owing to the bankruptcy of the cable contractor during construction, a system of electric traction using electric locomotives--an experimental technology at the time--was chosen instead. Given the small dimension of the tunnels as well as the difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation, steam power, as used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible for a deep tube railway. Like Greathead's earlier Tower Subway, the CL&SS was intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed. Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:\nThe Patent Cable Tramway Corporation owned the rights to the Hallidie cable-car system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10 mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12 mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.\nIt is reported that this problem with the CL&SS contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL&SS chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.\nThe solution adopted was electrical power, provided via a third rail beneath the train, but offset to the west of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C&SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather & Platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts (actually +500 volts in the northbound tunnel and -500 volts in the southbound) from the third rail and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.\nTo avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.\nWhen opened in 1890, the line had six stations and ran for in a pair of tunnels between the City of London and Stockwell, passing under the River Thames:\nStockwell\nThe Oval (now Oval)\nKennington\nElephant & Castle\nBorough\nKing William Street\nThe original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. These trains were however, preserved in London Transport Museum as the first static exhibit to the metro train.\nThe diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains, and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed padded cells. The railway was extended several times north and south, eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of from Camden Town in north London to Morden in Surrey.\nAlthough the C&SLR was well used, low ticket prices and the construction cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C&SLR became part of the Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C&SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.\nThe CCE&HR (commonly known as the \"Hampstead Tube\") was opened in 1907 and ran from Charing Cross (known for many years as Strand) via Euston and Camden Town (where there was a junction) to Golders Green and Highgate (now known as Archway). It was extended south by one stop to Embankment in 1914 to form an interchange with the Bakerloo and District lines. In 1913 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), owner of the CCE&HR, took over the C&SLR, although they remained separate companies.\nDuring the early 1920s, a series of works was carried out to connect the C&SLR and CCE&HR tunnels to enable an integrated service to be operated. The first of these new tunnels, between the C&SLR's Euston station and the CCE&HR's station at Camden Town, had originally been planned in 1912 but had been delayed by World War I. The second connection linked the CCE&HR's Embankment and C&SLR's Kennington stations and provided a new intermediate station at Waterloo to connect to the main line station there and the Bakerloo line. The smaller-diameter tunnels of the C&SLR were expanded to match the standard diameter of the CCE&HR and the other deep tube lines.\nExtensions\nIn conjunction with the works to integrate the two lines, two major extensions were undertaken: northwards to Edgware in Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Barnet) and southwards to Morden in Surrey (then in the Merton and Morden Urban District, but now in the London Borough of Merton).\nThe Edgware extension used plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway (E&HR) which the UERL had taken over in 1912. It extended the CCE&HR line from its terminus at Golders Green to Edgware in two stages: to Hendon Central in 1923 and to Edgware in 1924. The line crossed open countryside and ran on the surface, apart from a short tunnel north of Hendon Central. Five new stations were built to pavilion-style designs by Stanley Heaps, head of the Underground's Architects Office, stimulating the rapid northward expansion of suburban developments in the following years.\nThe engineering of the Morden extension of the C&SLR from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.\nThe resulting line became known as the Morden-Edgware line, although a number of alternative names were also mooted in the fashion of the contraction of Baker Street & Waterloo Railway to \"Bakerloo\", such as \"Edgmor\", \"Mordenware\", \"Medgway\" and \"Edgmorden\". With Egyptology very much in fashion after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, there was also a proposal to call the line the Tootancamden Line as it passed through both Tooting and Camden. It was eventually named the Northern line from 28 August 1937, reflecting the planned addition of the Northern Heights lines.\nAfter the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) were brought under public control in the form of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933, the MR's subsidiary, the Great Northern & City Railway, which ran from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, became part of the Underground as the Northern City Line. In preparation for the Northern Heights Plan, it was operated as part of the Northern line, although it was never connected to it.\nThe Northern Heights\nIn June 1935, the LPTB announced the New Works Programme, an ambitious plan to expand the Underground network which included the integration of a complex of existing London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) lines north of Highgate through the Northern Heights. These lines, built in the 1860s and 1870s by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&LR) and its successors, ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate, with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. The line taken over would be extended beyond Edgware to Brockley Hill, Elstree South and Bushey Heath with a new depot at Aldenham. The extension's route was that planned for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway (W&ER), using rights obtained from the earlier purchase of the W&ER (which had long intended an extension of the EH&LR Edgware route towards Watford). This also provided the potential for further extension in the future; Bushey's town planners reserved space in Bushey village for a future station and Bushey Heath station's design was revised several times to ensure this option would remain available in the future.\nThe project involved electrification of the surface lines (operated by steam trains at the time), the doubling of the original single-line section between Finchley Central and the proposed junction with the Edgware branch of the Northern line, and the construction of three new linking sections of track: a connection between Northern City Line and Finsbury Park station on the surface; an extension from Archway to the LNER line near East Finchley via new deep-level platforms below Highgate station; and a short diversion from just before the LNER's Edgware station to the Underground's station of the same name.\nThe peak-hour service pattern was to be 21 trains an hour each way on the High Barnet branch north of Camden Town, 14 of them via the Charing Cross branch and seven via the Bank branch. 14 would have continued on beyond Finchley Central, seven each on the High Barnet and Edgware branches. An additional seven trains an hour would have served the High Barnet branch, but continued via Highgate High-Level and Finsbury Park to Moorgate, a slightly shorter route to the City. It does not seem to have been intended to run through trains to the ex-Northern City branch from Edgware via Finchley Central. Seven trains an hour would have served the Alexandra Palace branch, to/from Moorgate via Highgate High-Level. In addition to the 14 through trains described, the ex-Northern City branch would have had 14 four-car shuttle trains an hour.\nWork began in the late 1930s, and was in progress on all fronts by the outbreak of World War II. The tunnelling northwards from the original Highgate station (now Archway) had been completed, and the service to the rebuilt surface station at East Finchley started on 3 July 1939, but without the opening of the intermediate (new) Highgate Station, at the site of the LNER's station of the same name. Further progress was disrupted by the start of the war, though enough had been made to complete the electrification of the High Barnet branch onwards from East Finchley over which tube services started on 14 April 1940; the new (deep-level) Highgate station opened on 19 January 1941. The single track LNER line to Edgware was electrified as far as Mill Hill East, including the Dollis Brook Viaduct, opening as a tube service on 18 May 1941 to serve the barracks there, thus forming the Northern line as it is today. The new depot at Aldenham had already been built and was used to build Halifax bombers. Work on the other elements of the plan was suspended late in 1939.\nPreparatory work including viaducts and a tunnel had been started but not completed on the Bushey extension pre-war. After the war, the area beyond Edgware was made part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, largely preventing the anticipated residential development in the area, and the potential demand for services from Bushey Heath thus vanished. Available funds were directed towards completing the eastern extension of the Central line instead, and the Northern Heights plan was dropped on 9 February 1954. Aldenham depot was converted into an overhaul facility for buses.\nThe implemented service from High Barnet branch gave good access both to the West End and the City. This appears to have undermined traffic on the Alexandra Palace branch, still run with steam haulage to Kings Cross via Finsbury Park, as Highgate (low-level) was but a short bus ride away and car traffic was much lighter than it would become later. Consequently, the line from Finsbury Park to Muswell Hill and Alexandra Palace via the surface platforms at Highgate was closed altogether to passenger traffic in 1954. This contrasts with the decision to electrify the Epping-Ongar branch of the Central line, another remnant of the New Works programme, run as a tube-train shuttle from 1957. A local pressure group, the Muswell Hill Metro Group, campaigns to reopen this route as a light-rail service. So far there is no sign of movement on this issue: the route, now the Parkland Walk, is highly valued by walkers and cyclists, and suggestions in the 1990s that it could, in part, become a road were met with fierce opposition. Another pressure group has proposed using the track bed further north, as part of the North and West London Light Railway. The connection between Drayton Park and the surface platforms at Finsbury Park was opened in 1976, when the Northern City Line became part of British Rail.\nRecent developments\nIn 1975, the Northern City Line, known by that time as the Highbury branch, was transferred from London Underground to British Rail; it is now served by Great Northern. In the past, before the introduction of the 1995 stock, the Northern line was sometimes nicknamed the \"Misery Line\" in the press because of its perceived unreliability.\nIn 2003, a train derailed at Camden Town. Although no one was hurt, points, signals and carriages were damaged, and the junctions there were not used while repairs were under way: trains coming from Edgware worked the Bank branch only, and trains from High Barnet and Mill Hill East worked the Charing Cross branch only. This situation was resolved when the junctions reopened, after much repair work and safety analysis and testing by contractor, on 7 March 2004.\nOn 7 July 2005 a defective train on the Northern line (causing its subsequent suspension) saved a Northern line train from being blown up as part of a terrorist attack on the London Underground and bus systems. Three trains on the Circle and Piccadilly lines were blown up. The Northern line bomber-to-be instead boarded a bus, which he later blew up.\nOn 13 October 2005 the Northern line service was suspended due to maintenance problems with the emergency braking system on the entire train fleet. A series of rail replacement buses was used to connect outlying stations with other Underground lines. Full service was restored on 18 October.\nFrom June 2006, the service between East Finchley and Camden Town was suspended for two non-consecutive weekends every month, with service on the Edgware branch suspended for the other two weeks. This was part of Tube Lines's redevelopment of some Edgware and High Barnet Branch stations, including replacement of track, signals, as well as station maintenance. This included refurbishment of all High Barnet branch stations from West Finchley to Camden Town. In October 2006, off-peak service between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central was cut back to a shuttle, except for a few weekend through trains.\nOn 13 August 2010, a defective rail maintenance train caused disruption on the Charing Cross branch, after it travelled four miles in 13 minutes without a driver. The train was being towed to the depot after becoming faulty. At Archway station, the defective train became detached and ran driverless until coming to a stop at an incline near Warren Street station. This caused morning rush-hour services to be suspended on this branch. All passenger trains were diverted via the Bank branch, with several not stopping at stations until they were safely on the Bank branch.\nThe Northern line was originally scheduled to switch to automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and for a number of years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit from the experience of installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It is now being undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade would be complete by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014 with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO.\nReferences\nNotes\nLondon Underground lines\nTransport in the London Borough of Barnet\nTransport in the London Borough of Merton\nTransport in the City of London\nTransport in the City of Westminster\nTransport in the London Borough of Camden\nTransport in the London Borough of Haringey\nTransport in the London Borough of Islington\nTransport in the London Borough of Lambeth\nTransport in the London Borough of Southwark\nTransport in the London Borough of Wandsworth\nTunnels underneath the River Thames\n1890 establishments in the United Kingdom\n1890s establishments in England", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern%20line"}

This is sometimes (but not always) used to decide whether they are different languages or different dialects.\nThere are noticeable differences in accent, vocabulary, and spelling between British and General American English, but speakers can largely understand each other without serious problems. These dialects are therefore mutually intelligible.\nSometimes, even different languages can be mutually intelligible.Hindi and Urdu are called different languages, but speakers of both languages can largely understand each other if they are using everyday language. This is because the two languages used to be dialects of Hindustani, the official language of British India until India became independent. Since the two languages are so alike, they are sometimes called together as Hindi-Urdu.\nAlso, dialects of a certain language can sometimes be mutually unintelligible. Chinese, for example, has hundreds of different dialects, and many native speakers of those dialects cannot understand each other without knowing the other's dialect. For example, the local dialects of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are Mandarin, Shanghainese/Wu Chinese, and Cantonese/Yue in that same order. If natives from each of these cities were to talk to each other in their native dialects, they would not understand each other. This is because they are too different from each other. This is why the governments of China and Taiwan want their citizens to speak Standard Mandarin in public so that there can be a spoken dialect of Chinese everyone can understand. While the spoken dialects are mutually unintelligible, they all use the same written code, Chinese characters, so they can understand each other if they write to each other.\nThese examples above show that the difference between language and dialect is often hard to define, even for linguists, or people who study languages as their job.\nWhen a speaker of one language can understand what a speaker of another language is saying but not the other way around, it is called asymmetric intelligibility. An example of of this is Portuguese and Spanish. While Portuguese speakers say they can understand Spanish without major problems, Spanish speakers, on the other hand, have a very difficult time understanding Portuguese speakers. This situation is actually quite common across languages.\nLanguage", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual%20intelligibility"}

In 1948 its leader Daniel Francois Malan became Prime Minister of South Africa, and the party began instituting apartheid in South Africa. However, apartheid was only one among a variety of issues that helped bring the National Party to power. Most people who voted for the National Party in 1948 were voting more against the previous United Party led by Jan Smuts than for Malan's National Party. This was because of Smuts's support of the United Kingdom in the Second World War, and other issues that irritated Afrikaner voters such as the poverty of Afrikaners, the competition from native Africans for jobs, the urbanization of Afrikaner towns, and the threat of communism, which the Afrikaner voters generally felt Smuts had wrongly handled and felt that the problems were partially his fault. South African President FW de Klerk, the last South African government leader to belong to the party, disbanded apartheid in the 1990s and allowed all adults of all races to vote for the first time in 1994, which resulted in the National Party being voted out of office.\nReferences\nPolitical parties in South Africa\nNationalist organizations in South Africa\nConservative parties\n1915 establishments\n1997 disestablishments\n1910s establishments in Africa", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Party%20of%20South%20Africa"}

They are originally from North America. They have spread through Central America, and live in various habitats. They have escaped in some parts of Eurasia (see map), and now live there as well. Raccoons are in the family Caniformia, and are related to the mustelids.\nThe raccoon has short legs, a pointed nose, small ears, grayish-brown fur, and a bushy tail.\nThe raccoon's most distinctive features are its multi-purpose front paws, its facial 'mask', and its striped tail. Moreover, raccoons are noted for their intelligence. Studies show they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. Raccoons are usually nocturnal. Their food is about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates. Raccoons are omnivores. They feed on mice, squirrels, rabbits, birds, fish, frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, eggs, insects, worms, fruit, and nuts. Their predators are red foxes, wolves, coyotes, bears, eagles, hawks, owls, cougars, and lynxes.\nMost raccoons live in the wild. Being around humans does not bother them. They often nest in empty buildings, garages, sheds, and even the attics of houses. Raccoons do not hibernate in the winter. Those that live further north where it is colder, grow thick coats to keep them warm and spend long periods sleeping. Raccoons that live in captivity can survive up to 20 years. In the wild, they usually live only 1-3 years.\nTwo other species of raccoon, the crab-eating raccoon (P. cancrivorus) and the Cozumel Island raccoon (P. pygmaeus), are extremely similar to the common raccoon. The crab-eating raccoon is quite widespread in eastern South America.\nAfter a gestation period (pregnancy) of about 65 days, two to five young are born in spring. Newborn raccoons are called \"kits\".\nA raccoon climbed a building in Minnesota.\nReferences\nOther websites\nProcyonids\nMammals of North America\nOmnivores", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon"}
{"doc_id": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia:train:154", "title": "Harmonic series (music)", "text": "Harmonics in music are notes which are produced in a special way. They are notes which are produced as part of the \"harmonic series\".\nIn physics, a harmonic is a wave which is added to the basic fundamental wave. This article talks about sound waves, which can be understood clearly by looking at the strings of a musical instrument.\nWhen a violinist plays a note on a violin string, the string starts to vibrate very fast. This vibration makes the air vibrate and the sound waves travel to our ear so that we can hear it. If the note were absolutely pure the string would move in a perfect sinusoidal shape and produce only one frequency, but instead there are multiple frequencies being produced at the same time along with the main one. The note played on the violin string makes the string vibrate in a very complicated way. There is the basic note (the fundamental), but added to that are lots of other little notes that all add up to a sound in a special way that tells us that it is a violin playing and not a clarinet or a human voice.\nThe higher the note, the faster the string vibrates. An A above middle C (the violinist's A string) vibrates at 440Hz (440 times per second). This is the \"fundamental\" or \"first harmonic\". The second harmonic vibrates twice as fast (ratio 2:1): 880Hz. This gives an A an octave higher. The third harmonic will give a ratio 3:2. This will be an E (an octave and a fifth above the fundamental). The higher the harmonic the quieter it is, but the ratio is always a whole number (not a fraction).\nEvery note that is played on an instrument is really a combination of several notes or \"harmonics\", even though we may not realize that we are hearing more than one note at a time. Play the lowest C on the piano. Now find the next C which is an octave higher. Press this key very slowly so that it does not sound and hold it down. While holding it down play the bottom C again making it loud and very short. The C that is being held silently will now sound. This is because the strings of that C are vibrating a little because it is a harmonic of the low C (they can vibrate because the damper is off the string while the note is being held down). The same can be done holding the next G down, then the next C, then the E. The higher the note the fainter (quieter) the harmonics become. The musical example below shows the notes of a harmonic series in musical notation.\nTo hear the notes of a harmonic series click here:\nclicking here.\nPlaying harmonics on instruments\nMusicians sometimes need to play harmonics on their instruments. In musical notation this is shown by placing a small circle above the note.\nA violinist can place their finger very lightly on a string so that it divides the string into half. They will hear a harmonic (the note an octave higher than the open string). By placing their fingers in other places they can get more harmonics, e.g. by touching the string a quarter of the way down they gets the next harmonic. \"Artificial harmonics\" can be played by stopping a string with the finger in the usual way (so that the string is now shorter) and placing the little finger farther up the string to get a harmonic of the stopped note. Artificial harmonics are written with diamond-shaped note heads. They are very hard to play well.\nHarpists can play harmonics with their left hand by stopping the string with the side of the hand (near the little finger) and plucking with the thumb or finger. Up to 3 notes can be played by the left hand. They can play harmonics with the right hand by stopping the string with the upper knuckle of the second finger and plucking with the thumb. Only one harmonic note can be played by the right hand. Harmonics on the harp sound very beautiful.\nPlayers of woodwind and brass instruments play many of their notes by blowing slightly stronger (overblowing) to get a higher series of notes. Instruments such as the recorder can play chords by making several harmonics sound together, but this is extremely difficult to do well and only found in modern music for virtuoso players.\nMusic theory\nSound", "source": "pszemraj/simple_wikipedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic%20series%20%28music%29"}

It featured lead vocals by the likes of Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, and others famous British singers too. Jordan Galland, an American musican also contributed to it. The artists performed cover songs, (which means the songs were new 'versions' of old songs - the word \"version\" was originally used in this context by the Reggae scene) but what made this second album stand out was the return to the use of professional arrangers and a full brass section. At a time when other producers such as Timbaland had made a name for themselves by producing simple stripped down backing beats, the sound was a complete change of direction. The brass section that Ronson used was the Dap-Kings who usually performed with Sharon Jones.

He began playing the violin at the age of 6. His mother died when he was 9. He was taken by his father to Vienna, where his teachers included Max Weissgarber. Soon the political situation became dangerous for Jews in Austria and so, in 1938, the young Nissel was sent from Vienna to Great Britain.\nWhen World War II started Nissel was interned on the Isle of Man. There he met the violinist Peter Schidlof and later Norbert Brainin. They played a lot of music together. Then they were set free because they were talented musicians. They studied with the famous violin teacher Max Rostal. There they met the British cellist, Martin Lovett whose wife was a pupil of Rostal. The four men played string quartets together, with Peter Schidlof now playing viola. At first they called themselves the Brainin Quartet, but then Nissel had the idea of the name Amadeus Quartet (Amadeus being one of Mozart's names).\nThe Amadeus Quartet (which their friends often called the Wolf Gang), gave its first concert in the Wigmore Hall, London in 1948. The hall was full and hundreds of people were turned away. After this concert they were invited to perform all over the world. They became the most famous string quartet group of their time. They made about 200 recordings. They were especially known for playing quartets by the great classical composers Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, but they also played works by 20th-century composers such as Bartok and Benjamin Britten (who wrote his third quartet for them).\nNissel was the one who organized all the business side for the group.\nWhen Schidlof died from a heart attack in 1987, the Amadeus Quartet no longer existed. Nissel became a well-known teacher of young quartets at the Royal Academy of Music.\nAlthough he had an operation for a brain tumour in 1960 and also a heart bypass he lived to the age of 86. He was a family man who had a wife, son, daughter and three grandchildren.

The rules and gear of kendo were first created in the 18th century, and its modern rules and styles date to the 19th century.\nRules\nAn opponent may be struck at seven places: both sides and top of helmet (men), on either hand (gloves, kote) or either side of the body breastplate (do). There is also one legal thrust (tsuki) on throat.\nThe \"men\" can only be struck from face, not from back. However, only one of the two hands can be struck, it depends on which kind of posture(\"kamae\") your opponent are using. A struck to the right side of body(one kind of \"do\") will often be ignored by referee because in the old days samurai will have a smaller sword in this position, which gives this position a good protection. Very important, because \"tsuki\" is somehow dangerous, junior practicer perform \"tsuki\" is forbidden both in match and daily training.\nIn a match, the attacker must name the location of each strike. Often, name these locations by Japanese list before(\"men\",\"kote\",\"do\",\"tsuki\"), but some people will name it by Korean or Chinese or other language, or even a meaningless shout. All these kinds of shout name \"kiai\". An effective attack must contains \"kiai\" besides other essential factors.\nEquipment\nThe weapon used in kendo is a bamboo sword, called shinai. The kendo armour, which the players must wear, is called bogu and is made of a helmet (men), breastplate (do), waist protector (tare), and special gloves (kote).\nLesson contents\nLesson is called keiko in kendo. keiko means that We think about past. kendo's keiko is distinguished between shinai keiko and kata keiko. the building which we do kendo is called dojyo.
